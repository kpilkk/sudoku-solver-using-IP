This project aims to solve sudokus that you can find in news papers/magazines. You can put the image of the sudoku you want to solve in the images folder and provide it's name after running the main.py file. The code will at first apply IP techniques to find the contents of the SUDOKU in the picture and then solves it. You can also edit the detected Sudoku before solving in case of false detection. For solving the sudoku backtracking algorithm is used.
